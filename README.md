## Description 

From the animated landing screen to skillsets, projects, and contact page, everything here is designed with a strong emphasis on UI/UX, animation, and accessibility. Technologies used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript and design tools like Figma and Photoshop. The custom fonts and background videos add a dynamic yet personal feel, echoing my love for both aesthetic design and functional development.
